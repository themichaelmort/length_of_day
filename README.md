# length_of_day

Answering my friend Logan Nielsen's question about the length of the day. His question:

"Do I have any math nerd 🤓 connections? I've got a Q that my brain is too small for 🧠

At what rate does the amount of variation in the length of days increase exponentially or linearly as you move north from the equator?

Let's assume the sun's rays come in perpendicular to the equator and we live on a sphere.

If the earth were flat and perpendicular to the sun I think this would be a pretty straightforward high school calculus question.

But the part that makes it hard for me to solve analytically is that we live on a curve...

I think I could code something up to get a numerical approximation but I'm interested in solving this the "pure math" way.

Thanks!"


To do this the math way, you would calculate the length of the great circle in the sunlight at each latitude. See the Great Circle Distance article on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance).
